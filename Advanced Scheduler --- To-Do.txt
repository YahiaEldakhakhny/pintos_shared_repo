Advanced Scheduler TO-DO LIST

BEWARE => Any additions are put above magic.
	   => Make sure to check that the thread is not idle before diving into the juicy stuff (updating variables/executing actions).
	   => load_avg must be updated exactly when timer_ticks () % TIMER_FREQ == 0.

Macros => NICE_MIN (-20), NICE_MAX (20), NICE_NORM (0), RECENT_CPU_INIT (0)

Variables => nice & recent_cpu (initialized in thread_init) (in Thread Struct) + load_avg (global)

Functions B.1 => int thread_get_nice (void) --> Returns the current thread’s nice value
		  B.1 => void thread_set_nice (int new_nice) --> Sets the current thread’s nice value to new nice and recalculates the thread’s priority
			     based on the new value. If the running thread no longer has the highest priority, it yields.
		  B.2 => void calculate_advanced_priority (struct thread *cur) --> updates thread priority
		  B.3 => void thread_get_recent_cpu (struct thread *cur) --> Calculates the current thread’s recent cpu value 100 times, rounded to the nearest
				 integer and stores it in the thread's recent_cpu.
		  B.4 => void thread_get_load_avg (void) --> Calculates the current system load average 100 times, rounded to the nearest integer.
		  B.6 => Fixed-Point Shenanigans --> DONE
