# PintOS Shared Repo

## Project Description
Built a priority scheduler to manage threads in the OS, and another scheduler (advanced scheduler) that follows the BSD architecture.


if you edit any file in your pintos instance add that file using the `track` script so that everyone else
in the team can see your changes and use them locally

For more details on the `track` script click [here](https://github.com/YahiaEldakhakhny/pintos_installation.git)
